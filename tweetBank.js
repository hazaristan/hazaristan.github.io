`The Hazara in Afghanistan are at serious risk of genocide. Taliban and IS-K are the main organizers of these explosions.`,
`Intention behind these attacks is not only to kill its youth, and to inable the future of a community. But, by force displacement a vulnerable condition is created where the Hazara community will not thrive and prosper in the long term.`,
`"Hazara are not Moslems. You can kill them. It's not a sin."
said by Mullah Abdul Manan, former spokesman of Taliban.`,
`Risk factor 10.3 concerns: "widespread or systematic discriminatory or targeted practices or violence against the lives, freedom or physical and moral integrity of protected group." It really refers to Hazara situation.`,
`In the present Convention, genocide means any actions which is an intent threat to human beings such as, killing them, hurting their physical or mental health, putting their life under restrictions.NEGLECTING all the aspects of genocide is a part of it.`,
`Specific intent to destroy in whole or in part is often considered as one of the most difficult elements of the legal definition of genocide, in which is going on Hazaras.`,
`Dr Chiovenda testified in the oral hearing: "I have concerns that Hazara have been experiencing  structural violence and systematic exclusion. This may also be left out and more impacted by the humanitarian crisis.`,
`As emphasised by Hussain, Hussein, and Rezaee in their written submissions, "in June 2021, Taliban searched room to room and were only killing Hazara workers while leaving other ethnic employees unharmed.`,
`Chapter II, Sections 1 and 2.1., demonstrates that the Hazara community has been subjected to mass killing, and especially in bombings targeting schools and hospitals in predominately Hazara neighbourhoods and mosques attended by Hazara Shias.`,
`In 23 May 2022,Prof. Gregory Stanton in his oral testimony added that ‘all of the basic factors that lead to genocide are present in these massacres of Hazaras.`,
`The analysis suggests that many of the risk factors of genocide are present. As 
such, Hazara in Afghanistan are at risk of genocide.`,
`Risk factor 10.4 refers to the development of policies or measures that seriously affect the reproductive rights of women or that contemplate the separation or forcible transfer of children belonging to protected group.`,
`One of the written submissions indicated that "for more than a hundred years, regimes in Afghanistan have not only banned Hazara from speaking out about their historical massacre, they aren't even allowed to their human rights."`,
`Risk factor 10.2 refers to the targeted physical elimination.
This is visible in the targeted attacks, and especially bombings, in Hazara neighbourhoods, and on schools, mosques, hospitals, maternity wards.`,
`Risk factor 9.6 concerns the ‘lack of national mechanisms or initiatives to deal with identity-based tensions or conflict.’  Despite the decades of persecution against the Hazara, there have been no investigations and prosecutions of the crimes`,
`Hazara people are the most underprivileged citizens of Afghanistan since they have been under systematic discrimination. They aren't only allowed to do politics, but not being able to attend to school.`,
`Dr Chiovenda submitted in her written evidence that Until 2002, [Hazara] had largely been excluded from governmental positions and educational opportunities which It's still in progress under the Taliban rules as none of the current 53 minister is Hazara.`,
`Prof. Stanton noted in his oral testimony that ‘the organisation that had been used against Hazara was a typical terrorist organisation. But unfortunately under the Taliban, it is actually a state organisation, ongoing persecution by the Taliban and by IS-K`,
`Evidence suggests that the Hazara have been excluded from various basic services for many years. Initially, the nationa electricity line was meant to run through a Hazara area, but the plan had changed since it was a Hazara-populated area.`,
`To date, none of the crimes carried out against Hazara has been investigated. None of the perpetrators have been charged and no actions towards justice for victims and families has been pursued.`,
`Risk factor 9.2 concerns the denial of the existence of protected groups or recognition of elements of their identity, as it is being done on Hazaras.`,
`Hazara people have been living in a context of social discrimination, political marginalisation and genocide since 1890, when Emir Abdur Rahman Khan conquered the lands of Hazaristan with unprecedented violence and eliminated about 62% of the population.`,
`The trend of excluding Hazara from important governmental positions continues now under the Taliban rule as ‘none of the Taliban’s current 53 ministers is a Hazara.`,
`Many Hazara policewomen in Afghanistan were persecuted and disappeared in an unusual way.`,
`Taliban have forcibly displaced hundreds of Hazara families from their homes and lands in Day Kundi, Ghor, Behsud and are facilitating the illegal seizure of Hazaristan regions by the Pashtun nomads.`,
`The practice of forced displacement is yet another crime that has been used against the Hazara community for centuries.`,
`In October 2021, Human Rights Watch reported that the Taliban and associated militias forcibly evicted hundreds of Hazara families from the Southern Helmand province and the northern Balkh province.`,
`Dr.Melissa, professor of anthropology noted that after August 2021, the Taliban have instated forced evictions and ethnic cleansing of Hazara and others opposing their government in several areas of Afghanistan including Daikundi, and Uruzgan.`,
`The forced relocation of thousands of Hazaras and [Shias] to various provinces and their expulsion from their ancestral homelands resumed in the months after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021`,
`The Taliban takeover in August 2021 was followed by the forcible displacement of Hazara people.`,
`Taliban are carrying genocide and systematic crimes against ethnic and religious minorities, women, humanity, journalists, and girl's school. The explosion outside a school in west Kabul is an incident which the students were mostly Hazara girls.`,
`Journalists also have come under increasing attacks. Local Taliban leaders circulate hit lists and threaten reporters and their families. In March 2021, IS-K killed 3 female journalists. They have forced many reporters to go into hiding or flee the country.`,
`This is particularly the case during the Hazara genocide of the late 1800s, when Hazara women and girls were enslaved, and many were raped. Still, since the Taliban takeover, the humanitarian situation only has deteriorated for the Hazara in Afghanistan.`,
`The strategies and tactics the Amir employed during the 1891–93 Hazara War clearly demonstrate that he was seeking to neutralise the Hazaras, politically, economically and socially as a distinctive ethnic group.`,
`The mass killing, enslavement, destruction and displacement that occurred during the war by Amir Abdul Rahman can best be considered as the prime example of genocide in the history of modern Afghanistan.`,
`In Uruzgan, just 60 families survived from Sultan Ahmad powerful tribe, while it constituted 3000 families. This extent of the destruction and killing in Hazaristan was documented by the Amir's own officials.`,
`In addition to those who fled, a large number of Hazaras were sold as slaves in a burgeoning trade that was officially taxed and sanctioned by the Afghan state`,
`We have witnessed the massacre of Hazaras many times. DAYKUNDI is an obvious example of the massacre in the last few days. Killing 12 members of a family for NO REASON!`,
`Despite promises to protect the Hazaras from threats, the Taliban have committed targeted attacks and have forcibly displaced thousands of Hazara civilians. DAYKUNDI is a recent example that they killed 12 members of a family.`,
`The Hazara community is experiencing increasing and widespread attacks alongside a history of persecution. Recently, Taliban killed all the members of a family including women and children in DAYKUNDI`,
`The situation of the Hazara in Afghanistan will not improve without the international community putting pressure on the Taliban to act to protect the community. Otherwise Taliban will continue killing Hazaras as they did In DAYKUNDI 3 days ago.`,
`Despite the political and cultural openings in Afghanistan after 2001, the Hazaras faced continued discrimination and new types of violence from Talliban. DAYKUNDI has faced the most terrible violence 3 days ago.`,
`Hazaras commonly believe that they lost more than 62 percent of their population between 1891 and 1893. But now, it is being repeated again by Taliban. Daykundi was the last victim and that would not be the last, too.`,
`Women and girls especially have suffered systematic attacks on their rights under the Taliban. All the demonstrations were held by women in Afghanistan because of their rights. But they were ignored!`,
`The Taliban have failed to provide protection for the Hazaras. Actually, They themselves tried to kill the innocent people. On 24th Nov. 2022, Around 12 people were killed by Taliban in DAYKUNDI.`,
`The Taliban have forcibly displaced thousands of Hazaras from their ancestral lands across the country . The examples are the last happenings in Daykundi. 11 were killed, one was beheaded and the next day six people were arrested by Taliban.`,
`None of the crimes carried out against Hazaras have been investigated. None of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. No compensation for victims and their families has been paid.  And again, the same thing is going on in DAYKUNDI.`,
`On Thursday 24th November 2022, Taliban killed 11 people including 4 children and a woman. They also beheaded a man by the name of Amanullah Mali. 4 other people were arrested by Taliban and there's no information available about them.`,
`The Hazara people are the followers of Islam relegion. The majority of them are Shia, and a considerable number of them are Suni and a few of them are Esmaeili-Shia. In spite of the fact, they are considered as one single Hazara.`,
`The indigenous language of Hazara people is a kind of Persian language which is widely used in central Afghanistan which is called Hazara-Gi. They were traditionally living as ranchers in central or south-east areas.`,
`The existence of different civilizations in Hazara history has created many visible effects on Hazara custom. Also, being genetically related to Turkish people  and having relations with Iranian people change them to be so different from other people.`,
`The Hazara culture is the richest culture in Afghanistan which is so unique and influenced by middle and south Asia. Hazaristan is a very historical place which has been the location for stability of Greek, Ghaznavi, Ghuri, Islamic, Buddhist civilizations.`,
`Months before the Taliban takeover, violent attacks against the Hazaras resurged. The UN documented 20 incidents targeting Shi’a/Hazara civilians in the first six months of 2021, which killed 143 and injured more than 300 people.`,
`The Hazara constitut an estimated 20 percent of Afghanistan population. They have faced discrimination and persecution in Afghanistan for over a century particularly during the last period of Taliban rule in 1990s.`,
`In the first months after seizing control, the Taliban killed 13 Hazara men in Daykundi province and forcibly displaced thousands of Hazaras across several provinces, claiming the community had disputed rights to the land`,
`By july 2022, more than 25,000 primarily-Hazara people have been forcibly displaced from their homes by the Taliban’s military campaign and currently face intolerable conditions`,
`Despite promises to protect the Hazaras from threats, the Taliban have committed targeted attacks and have forcibly displaced thousands of Hazara civilians.`,
`The Taliban must immediately cease these acts of revenge and ensure employees of the former government and their families can live safely in Afghanistan`,
`These violent deaths are further shocking proof that the Taliban continue to persecute, torture and extrajudicially execute Hazara people.`,
`On the night of 26 June 2022, Taliban raided the home of Mohamad Muradi, a Hazara man and security official under the former government who had previously led a People’s Uprising Program force – a local militia – against the Taliban in 2020 and 2021.`,
`In Daikundi incident, a 14 year old child by the name of Mahdi, and an 11 year boy by the name of Mohammad was killed. Their only crime was being a Hazara, but Taliban called them rebels. Can a child be a rebel?`,
`Between 1892-1893, Abdul Rahman broke his promise and arrested all religious leaders of Hazaras. Most of them were shot and the others have been left in prison.
(Tarikh Melli Hazara book)`,
`The first uprising of Hazaras had started in April 1892, when the government soldiers rapped the wife of a Hazara tribe leader. They got decision to stand against this violence. 
(Tarikh Melli Hazara Book)`,
`Abdul Rahman had arrested and sold Hazara women and children as slaves and some of them were forced to be the wives of his soldiers. 
(Tarikh Melli Hazara book)`,
`After 1893, Amir of Kabul ordered to take all the agricultural lands of Hazara people in Hazaristan.
